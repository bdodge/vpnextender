Using A - Raspberry Pi W
Setup for headless WiFi SSH access from Linux desktop (probably works with Windows/Mac similarly)

1) using rpi-imager, select "RASPBERRY PI OS LITE (32-B?IT), your SD card and the "WRITE"
 
2) mount the SD card on your desktop, it should just mount when rpi-imager is done, or just remove it and stick it back in if it doesn't.

3) Linux, the boot partition is mounted on /media/<username>/boot.
    cd there
	
	> cd /media/<username>/boot
	
4) Enable ssh
	
	> echo " " > ssh
	
	That tells the pi to enable ssh on boot

5) Setup WiFi network
	
	edit a new file (in the boot directory) and add the contents
	
country=US
  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1

  network={
      ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
      psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
  }

     replacing wifi network and password with your own settings
	
	 save the file as "wpa_supplicant.conf"

6) Setup overlay for USB Gadget support

     edit the existing file "config.txt" on the boot partition

     at the end of the file add the text

dtoverlay=dwc2

     then save the file
	 
	 edit the existing file "cmdline.txt" on the boot partition.
	 in the command line, after "rootwait" add the text
	 
	 modules-load=dw2c
	 
	 so the cmdline looks something like:
	 
     console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=6e9a433e-02 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait modules-load=dwc2
	 
	 save that file, and unmount (eject) the SD card from your PC

7) put the SD card in the rPi and connect a single micro-USB cable
	 between it and your computer and wait a bit for the rPi to boot.
	 It might take a few minutes for the first boot. 
	 
8) ssh to the rPi from your PC as user "pi"
	 
	 > ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
	
	 You should get text like:
The authenticity of host 'raspberrypi.local (192.168.1.241)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:8e8jEymuLsPE4uCcBkC37G5XZx5j/qLgkXwEztfbaWA.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

     So type "yes" (or accept "yes")
	 
Warning: Permanently added 'raspberrypi.local,192.168.1.241' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

     Login to the rPi with the default password "raspberry"
	 
	 password: raspberry
	 
9) expand file-system and change user/password on the ssh prompt
	 
	 > sudo raspi-config
	
	 select "System Options" and "Password"
	 change your password to whatever. "pi" and select <Select>
	 
	 select "System Options" (if you went all the way back there)
	 then select "Hostname"
	 change the hostname to "vpn-extender<n>" where n is the
	 number of the extender if more than one, or just blank if you have one.
	 
	 select "Advanced Options" and "Expand Filesystem"
	 
	 say yes to "reboot", or, <Finish> and reboot by
	 
	 > sudo reboot
	 
10) Verify changes
	 
	 > ssh pi@vpn-extender.local
	 
	 (say yes to prompt)
	 
	 pi@vpn-extender.local's password: pi
	 
11) setup service for starting extender at boot. On the rPi prompt
	 
	 > cd /lib/systemd/system
	 > sudo nano vpn-extender.service
	 
	 add this content to that file

[Unit]
Description=A VPN extender
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
PIDFile=/run/vpnextender.pid
ExecStart=/home/pi/usbtunnel -c -r631 192.168.1.142

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
	 
	 Enable the service by
	 
	 > sudo systemctl enable vpn-extender.service
	 
	 which should create a link to the service file in /lib
	 
	 Test start it by:
	 
     > sudo systemctl start vpn-extender.service
	 
	 Then see the result in the syslog
	 
	 > tail /var/log/syslog
